### 英文自我介绍

I completed my undergraduate studies at Chang'an University. During my university internship, I received a full-time job offer, which led me to defer my postgraduate studies for one year. **I am currently pursuing my master's degree** at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Sydney, and I expect to graduate and return to China this September.



选择前端的原因

I chose frontend development because I find the user interaction aspects more engaging compared to backend CRUD operations. I prefer working with things that offer immediate visual feedback, which motivates me to explore and delve deeper into this field.
